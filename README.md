# Github API App
A simple python program which uses the Github API to do things.
The projects is made to gain more experience with the Github API and to start looking 
into the use of Poetry to better manage projects and dependencies.

This is a CLI project but might be updated to use Flask in the future (also to gain XP).

## Setup
1. Install Poetry using `pip install poetry`.
2. Navigate into the project's folder and create a virtual environement using `python3 -m venv <environment_name>`.
3. Activate the environment using `source <environment_name>/bin/activate`.
4. Run `Poetry install` to install all the required dependencies.
5. Run the project using `poetry run python3 githubapiapp/__init__.py`.
